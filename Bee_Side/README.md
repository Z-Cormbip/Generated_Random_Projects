## üí° What I Learned

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Design

- Leveraging Figma's design tokens and custom variables for consistency  
- Understanding the strengths and limits of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma  
- Starting rough sketches in raster (Photoshop), refining in vector (Illustrator)  
- Using Illustrator for advanced text treatments (e.g. text on path, warping)  
- Incorporating external CSS libraries and generators to accelerate layout development

### üß± HTML

- Using CSS-generated shapes instead of image imports for better performance  
- Writing cleaner, more semantic HTML structure  

### üé® CSS

- Applying `position: relative` and `absolute` for layout control  
- Creative use of `clip-path` and `border-radius` for custom shapes  
- Font scaling with `clamp()` for responsive typography  
- Managing `object-fit` behaviors with SVG and image content  
- Styling with pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for visual accents  
- Keeping selector nesting shallow and efficient  
- Recognizing the value of design-code balance and when to simplify

## üöß Challenges

- Maintaining responsiveness in a visually complex layout  
- Balancing time and energy between high-fidelity design and detailed code  
- Controlling layout overflow caused by clipped and shaped elements

## üß† Next Steps

- Focus on simpler, more maintainable design-to-code workflows  
- Build more projects using random creative prompts  
- Begin exploring JavaScript for interactivity and behavior
