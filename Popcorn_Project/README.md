## 👁️‍🗨️ Project Focus

- Simpler, more maintainable design-to-code workflows
- Build more projects using random creative prompts
- Begin exploring JavaScript for interactivity and behavior

## 🧪 Design Formula

- Start with layout wireframes (boxes and typography only)
- Design a few standout elements (logo, CTA, hero sections)
- Keep layout modular — reusable components with minimal overrides
- Optionally use BEM naming or a utility framework like Tailwind CSS
- Define and stick to a style system (spacing, fonts, colors)

## 🎨 Creative Exploration

- `#a5b6cb` is a cool tone — between navy and pastel — offering calmness with personality
- Aim for a playful, curvy design aesthetic that fits a popcorn brand
- Consider the context of popcorn: movies, TV nights, fun, and relaxation
