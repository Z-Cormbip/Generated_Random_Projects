## 💡 What I Learned

### 🛠️ Technology & Design

- Figma’s grid layout and wireframing tools  
- Figma's prototype feature for simulating touch interactions  
- Adobe Photoshop for color grading and visual effects (gradient maps, filters)  
- SVG optimization using SVGOMG and Figma plugins

### 🧱 HTML

- Efficient markup using **Emmet Abbreviations**  
- Clean and semantic HTML structure  

### 🎨 CSS

- Declaring custom variables in `:root` for consistency  
- Using `outline:` as a visual aid for spacing during development  
- Grouping selectors with shared properties for cleaner code  
- Applying `max-width` and `max-height` to preserve image proportions  
- Centering with `margin: 0 auto`  
- Responsive design using `@media` queries
